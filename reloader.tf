# install reloader.
# NB tls libraries typically load the certificates from ca-certificates.crt
#    file once, when they are started, and they never reload the file again.
#    reloader will automatically restart them when their configmap/secret
#    changes.
# NB the default values are described at:
#       https://github.com/stakater/reloader/blob/v2.1.5/deployments/kubernetes/chart/reloader/values.yaml
#    NB make sure you are seeing the same version of the chart that you are installing.
